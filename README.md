### ðŸŽ¯ Object
Implement Dining philosophers problem in two different way!

#### `philo_one`
philosopher with threads and mutex

- One fork between each philosopher, therefore there will be a fork at the right and at the left of each philosopher.
- To avoid deadlokc, you should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them.
- Each philosopher should be a thread and do not talk to each other 

#### `philo_bonus`
philosopher with processes and semaphore

- All the forks are in the middle of the table.
- They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by a semaphore.
- Each philosopher should be a process and the main process should not be a philosopher.

### ðŸ’» How to Run
```command
> git clone https://github.com/steveklabnik/dining_philosophers.git
> cd philo or philo_bonus
> make
> ./philo [philo_count] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] option([must_eat])
> ./philo_bonus [philo_count] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] option([must_eat])
example > ./philo 5 410 200 200
